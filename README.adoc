TODO Document how one can actually use - once it is end-user ready for initial beta testers.

This goal of this project is to fully automate the way too many manual steps currently described on
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:_Eclipse in order for anyone to get easily started
successfully hacking on https://www.opendaylight.org quickly.

This will be implemented used an Eclipse "Oomph" workspace set up model, see http://www.eclipse.org/oomph

This is a protoype which I'm starting on https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-eclipse-setup 
just because it's easier for me to maintain it here for now.  If this becomes used by others,
I expect we'll move it to https://git.opendaylight.org  
TODO which repo, new or inside an existing one?
